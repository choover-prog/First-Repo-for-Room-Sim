# Media-Room-Cal-Sim (Starter)

Open `public/index.html` to test viewer.

## UI Scaffold & Zones

The app now builds a four-region layout with navigation, viewer, controls dock, and shop panels.
Sidebar and dock collapse states as well as fullscreen mode persist to localStorage.

## Room Object Manager

Add speakers, subs, and a main listening position from the control dock. Edit roles, models, and XYZ coordinates with nudge controls. Save or load setups via `room.json` files or built-in templates. All room state persists to `localStorage` and objects are visualized in the main viewer.
