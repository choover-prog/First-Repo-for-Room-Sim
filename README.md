# Media-Room-Cal-Sim (Starter)

Open `public/index.html` to test viewer.

## UI Scaffold & Zones

The app now uses a four-zone layout with collapsible panels and fullscreen support.
Left and right sidebars plus a bottom dock can be toggled and their state is
persisted in `localStorage`. A fullscreen mode hides all side panels and expands
the viewer. Hotkeys: `[` and `]` collapse left/right, `F` toggles fullscreen.
